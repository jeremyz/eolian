Improve:
- when trying to add class name, which already in database, maybe should print
  which file is parsed right now.

To think about:
- virtual pure
- add name of data structure into eo file

- Can we have multiple constructors in Eo2?
  Do we need to write constructors in separate section ob JSON?
  in Py, C++, constructor has the same name. in Eo - not, what's in Eo2?

Fix in parsing
   (doesn't matter in JSON)
  - when splitting parameters, comma can be in comment!!!

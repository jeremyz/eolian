Improve:
- when trying to add class name, which already in database, maybe should print
  which file is parsed right now.

To think about:
- virtual pure
- add name of data structure into eo file

- Can we have multiple constructors in Eo2?
  Do we need to write constructors in separate section ob JSON?
  in Py, C++, constructor has the same name. in Eo - not, what's in Eo2?

Fix in parsing
   (doesn't matter in JSON)
  - when splitting parameters, comma can be in comment!!!

Issues:
  - Have to add {"legacy" : true} tag into Eo, because not for every OP_ID presents legacy EAPI.
    or {"legacy" : "legacy_func_name"} - good for "evas_object_show()"

    and there are lot of other cases, when legacy could not match autogenerated legacy.
    mainly "evas_object_smth", because class's name is "Evas_Smth" so newly generated API will be "evas_smth_".

    So added "legacy_override" tag (which can be "legacy") with legacy name,
    even if it matches autogenerated. Because we need to know, if function has legacy or not.

  - If there is no legacy, we will have manually check, if this func returns anything
    (needed mainly for Eo2)
  - Need to add Evas_Legacy2.h to define names which we changed:
    #define evas_object_show() evas_object_visibility_set(EINA_TRUE)
    evas_object_hide(). evas_object_move(), evas_object_resize()
    maybe smth else.

To think about:
- set properties; get properties

- add support for parameters (in:out:in,out)
- determine uniqness of class names in Eo. Is it going to be unique? Spaces, underscores, capital leters?

Fix in parsing
  - when splitting parameters, comma can be in comment!!!
  - space in class name when parsing *.eo
